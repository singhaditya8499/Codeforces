# Codeforces
I have uploaded all the codes which I have successfully submitted. I have looked up for some resources to solve some of the problems.


I love competetive programming. I wrote all these code in the span of 4 years of my college. But the codes are not important,
you can probably look them up for help but why would you, I ain't no tourist. I extracted all of these files using writing a
script in python and automating browser using Selenium. Seeing computer performing a task which is defined by you, feels pretty
amazing. Adios!
